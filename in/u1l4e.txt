Major features include the Rocky Mountains, the Appalachian Mountains, the Great Plains, the Mississippi River basin, the Great Lakes, and extensive coastlines along the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. The country's ecosystems range from forests (e.g., the Pacific Northwest rainforests) to deserts (e.g., the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts), grasslands (e.g., the Great Plains) and wetlands (e.g., the Everglades).}

::U1L4Q46::Answer the following questions.<br>What is the importance of extensive coastlines and access to shipping routes? How has this impacted the United States economically?{=Extensive coastlines and access to shipping routes have been crucial for the economic development of the United States. The country's strategic location between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, combined with its extensive coastlines, has facilitated international trade and commerce. Access to major shipping routes has enabled the efficient transportation of goods, raw materials, and finished products, contributing significantly to the growth of industries and the economy.}

::U1L4Q47::Answer the following questions.<br>Compare the Midwest region and the Great Plains as major agricultural production centers. What are their key crops?{=The Midwest region and the Great Plains are major agricultural production centers in the United States. The Midwest, with its fertile soils and favorable climate, is a significant producer of crops such as corn, soybeans, wheat and livestock. The Great Plains, known for its vast grasslands and semi-arid climate, is a major producer of crops like wheat, corn, sorghum and cattle ranching.}

::U1L4Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>Explain why transitioning to sustainable energy sources has become an increasing area of focus in the USA amid its abundant fossil fuel reserves.{=Despite its abundant fossil fuel reserves, the United States has increasingly focused on transitioning to sustainable energy sources due to concerns over environmental impact, climate change and the long-term sustainability of non-renewable resources. Renewable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, offer cleaner and more sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels. Additionally, the transition to sustainable energy sources aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate the effects of climate change and achieve greater energy independence.}

::U1L4Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>How has the diverse labor force provided the USA with a competitive economic advantage?
