::U7L2Q41::Answer the following questions.<br>What were some of the underlying historical causes and tensions that contributed to the outbreak of the Iraq-Iran War?{=The Iraq-Iran War from 1980-1988 had its roots in longstanding territorial, political, ethnic and religious tensions between the two countries. Specific drivers included: Iraq's desire to gain full control of the Shatt al-Arab waterway; Iranian calls to export its Islamic revolution which threatened Iraq's secular regime; ethnic Kurdish rebellions; and the 1979 Iranian Revolution which overturned the Iranian monarchy that Iraq had supported.}

::U7L2Q42::Answer the following questions.<br>How and why did the dynamic of the Iraq-Iran War shift from early Iraqi gains to an extended stalemate?{=Early in the war, Iraq made some swift advances and captured Iranian territory, hoping for a quick victory while Iran was weakened and disorganized after its revolution. However, Iran was soon able to stall Iraq's momentum. Iran's leaders framed the war as a patriotic defense of the revolution, helping them mobilize large volunteer militias. As the war bogged down into trench warfare and attrition, neither side could break the stalemate for most of the 1980s.}

::U7L2Q43::Answer the following questions.<br>In what ways did the Iraq-Iran War have severe and long-lasting consequences for both countries?{=The drawn-out Iraq-Iran War resulted in catastrophic costs for both countries, leaving long-term economic, social and political damage. Hundreds of thousands were killed or injured, economic development was setback, oil exports hampered and cities/infrastructure destroyed. It consolidated Saddam Hussein's authoritarian rule in Iraq but also fueled later domestic unrest. It led to further regional interventions down the line.}

::U7L2Q44::Answer the following questions.<br>How did Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait escalate tensions in the region and trigger an international response?{=Iraq's 1990 invasion and occupation of Kuwait led to a crisis as Kuwait's oil reserves gave Iraq potential regional dominance. The invasion threatened Saudi Arabia and prompted an urgent international response led by the US, resulting in the Gulf War in early 1991 to expel Iraqi forces from Kuwait.}

::U7L2Q45::Answer the following questions.<br>Analyze how technology and weapons, from airpower to chemical arms, impacted the prosecution and outcome of the Gulf War.{=The 1991 Gulf War saw modern high-tech weaponry employed on a large scale, including precision-guided bombs, stealth aircraft, cruise missiles and satellite coordination. This overwhelming US/coalition use of air power decimated Iraqi command, control, communications, infrastructure and combat capabilities - preparing the way for a ground assault.}

::U7L2Q46::Answer the following questions.<br>What were some of the significant political, economic and diplomatic effects of Iraq's defeat in the Gulf War?{=Iraq's defeat came at extraordinary cost - its military was devastated, economic assets ruined, and Saddam's prestige was harmed abroad and at home. Iraq was forced to destroy its advanced weapons programs andfaced punishing international sanctions for years after. It remained a pariah state in the region after the war.}

::U7L2Q47::Answer the following questions.<br>In what ways did the Iraq-Iran War and Gulf War have broader impacts on stability and security in the Middle East?{=The wars fueled greater militarization and interventionism in the Middle East, intensified Sunni-Shia sectarian divides, solidified US military presence and exacerbated instability that enabled groups like Al-Qaeda to gain footholds. They led to upheavals like the Iraqi Kurdish and Shia Arab revolts.}

::U7L2Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>How did the wars influence relations between key regional players and global powers?{=The invasion of Kuwait made strategic ties between the West and oil-rich Gulf Arab states much stronger. Tensions between Israel and Arab states eased with shared alarm over Iraq. But Iraq's defeat also fueled resentment toward US domination among some Arab groups. Iran gained leverage during the Gulf War by staying neutral.}

::U7L2Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>Discuss the human costs and humanitarian consequences of the wars on civilian populations.{=There was immense humanitarian suffering - estimates indicate combined war fatalities could exceed 500,000 lives, plus countless injured and displaced across the two wars. Iraq's suppression of rebellions after the Gulf War also killed tens of thousands. Environmental damage from burning oil wells also took a heavy toll.}

::U7L2Q50::Answer the following questions.<br>Why did Iraq's conflicts with Iran and Kuwait fail to decisively resolve regional power dynamics, leading to lingering tensions after the wars ended?{=Rather than resolving power balances, Iraq remained volatile after the wars while tensions persisted between it, Iran, Kurdish groups and even a newly assertive Saudi Arabia. Iraq's weakened state also opened the door for future US military intervention, setting the stage for internal strife and the eventual 2003 US invasion.}
