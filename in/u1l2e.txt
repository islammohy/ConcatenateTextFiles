The federal government oversees national-level issues, while state governments manage state-specific matters. Local governments handle community issues. States have autonomy but must follow certain federal laws.}

::U1L2Q44::Answer the following questions.<br>What is the purpose and importance of the U.S. census?{=The census counts the population every 10 years to determine representation in Congress, specifically seats in the House of Representatives.

::U1L2Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>How could understanding local contexts improve federal policymaking?{=Federal policies often impact communities unevenly. Understanding local contexts allows tailored solutions meeting regional needs. Input from local governments and community groups can make federal policies more responsive.}

::U1L2Q50::Answer the following questions.<br>Should statehood decisions consider cultural cohesion or only geographic proximity?{=There are reasonable arguments on both sides.

Balancing cultural and regional factors may be ideal.}

::U1L2Q51::Answer the following questions.<br>How does the census shape representation and resource allocation over time?{=The census determines seats in the House after population shifts, so growing states gain more representation. Data guides spending decisions, benefiting growing areas. Lagging investment in declining regions sparks calls for updated approaches.}

::U1L2Q52::Answer the following questions.<br>Could Hawaii's cultural integration serve as a model for the rest of America?{=Perhaps so. Hawaii's ability to fuse diverse cultures while upholding shared values offers lessons. Respectful inclusion of minority voices and exchange of cultural gifts bred unity. America may apply this "aloha spirit" more broadly.}
