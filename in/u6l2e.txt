::U6L2Q41::Answer the following questions.<br>Why did the United States adopt a policy of containing communism globally during the Cold War?{=The U.S. aimed to contain Soviet communist ideology and influence around the world in support of its capitalist allies. Containment arose from a view that the Soviet Union was highly expansionist and threatened U.S. interests as well as global stability and peace if its influence spread unchecked.}

::U6L2Q42::Answer the following questions.<br>How did events like the Berlin Blockade and Airlift increase Cold War tensions between the United States and Soviet Union?{=Events like the blockade and airlift directly confronted and opposed the superpowers’ interests in post-WWII Germany and Europe. They demonstrated willingness to take bold action in the face of aggression, rather than compromise, greatly ratcheting up tensions, distrust and ideological animosity between the two nations.}

::U6L2Q43::Answer the following questions.<br>What impact did the nuclear arms race have on Cold War military policy and foreign relations?{=The arms race drastically increased both nations' nuclear stockpiles, leading to policies like Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD), which assumed that neither side would attack due to nuclear deterrence. The threat of nuclear war heavily influenced events; the Cuban Missile Crisis brought the world near catastrophe. It deepened mistrust and constrained diplomatic options, nearly freezing superpower relations for decades.}

::U6L2Q44::Answer the following questions.<br>How did the construction of the Berlin Wall escalate Cold War tensions?{=The Berlin Wall’s construction in 1961 to divide East and West Berlin showed the Soviet Union's desperation to stem emigration and the failure of communism to retain citizens. It also physically and symbolically divided the city, gave rise to further repression by East Germany and brought Soviet communism’s differences with Western democracy into stark relief, showcasing communism's weakness. This embarrassed the USSR, escalating tensions and unwillingness to compromise.}

::U6L2Q45::Answer the following questions.<br>What global impact did events like the Berlin Airlift and the fall of the Berlin Wall have on the outcome of the Cold War?{=The Berlin Airlift showcased Western democratic resolve against Soviet aggression, likely deterring further action. The fall of the Berlin Wall proved the failure of repressive Soviet communist ideology, presaging rebellions across Eastern Europe in 1989-90 that culminated in the dissolution of the USSR itself, decisively ending the Cold War after nearly 50 years.}

::U6L2Q46::Answer the following questions.<br>Why was the Red Scare period significant in shaping domestic U.S. attitudes during the Cold War?{=The Red Scare fueled anti-communist attitudes and hysteria across the U.S. public and government during the 1940s-50s. Blacklisting and allegations of communist sympathy against celebrities, politicians and ordinary citizens led to persecution and ruined lives. The climate of fear and suspicion it engendered constrained policy options, impacted activism around rights and shaped U.S. cultural attitudes to dissidence and radical politics for decades after.}

::U6L2Q47::Answer the following questions.<br>How might events during the Cold War continue to influence global politics today?{=Cold War events created geopolitical spheres of influence, alliances and tensions that persist today between Russia, Europe, China and the U.S. Nuclear non-proliferation policies also remain shaped by the threat of nuclear catastrophe and deterrence theories like Mutually Assured Destruction developed during that period. Events like the Cuban Missile Crisis also provide cautionary tales about escalation risk relevant to present conflicts.}

::U6L2Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>What motivated leaders on both sides to avoid direct military conflict during the Cold War?{=Fears of uncontrolled escalation to catastrophic nuclear war and Mutually Assured Destruction that would destroy both nations constrained leaders once nuclear parity was achieved in the 1960s. Ideological opposition was also limited by economic interdependence and shared interests in avoiding large scale war so soon after WWII. However, these motivations narrowly prevented disaster several times (e.g. Cuban Missile Crisis).}

::U6L2Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>How did meetings between leaders and arms control treaties help ease Cold War tensions?{=Diplomatic overtures during détente, as well as arms limitation talks and treaties like SALT I and II, helped stabilize the nuclear arms race, build understanding, and achieve symbolic cooperation even amidst distrust - proving crucial in reducing global tensions. The thaw facilitated trade, cultural/educational exchanges, collaboration in space and greater restraint in proxy wars. This helped halt the escalatory cycle and later enabled the cooperation needed to end the Cold War peacefully.}

::U6L2Q50::Answer the following questions.<br>What relevance, if any, does political polarization between different ideologies have in the present day compared to during the Cold War?{=While communism vs. capitalism fueled Cold War polarization, ideological polarization persists today both globally and within many nations like the U.S. Issues may evolve but an ‘us vs them’ dynamic endures, complicating diplomacy and enabling political opportunism via division. Hyper-partisanship also leads to policy gridlock, illiberal tactics and erosion of civic trust, threatening stability and progress much like the Red Scare era damagingly fused policy debate with ideological loyalty tests. The Cold War example shows adversarial yet peaceful coexistence of diverging ideologies remains complex but necessary.}
