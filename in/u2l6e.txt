::U2L6Q43::Answer the following questions.<br>Discuss Moscow’s historical significance and its role in shaping Russia’s national identity.{=Moscow's historical significance stems from its founding in the 12th century and evolution into the political, economic and cultural heart of Russia. As the capital of the Grand Duchy of Moscow and later the Russian Empire and Soviet Union, Moscow shaped the national identity through domination of the region, imperial expansionism, and communist ideology.

::U2L6Q45::Answer the following questions.<br>Explain how Moscow’s city layout and transportation systems reflect different stages of its urban development over time.{=Moscow developed concentrically around the Kremlin citadel at its center, radiating outward with circular and radial boulevards.

Today's gridlock prompts new highways and rail lines.}

The Kremlin has continuously housed the head of state and military command, making it the nucleus of authority and national affairs.}

::U2L6Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>Discuss the climate and weather patterns that characterize Moscow’s seasons.{=Moscow has a humid continental climate with very cold, snowy winters due to its northerly continental interior position.

::U2L6Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>Compare Moscow to other major European capital cities like London or Paris in terms of history, architecture, culture, size and global influence.{=Like London and Paris, Moscow is a prominent capital with over a millennium of history influencing present-day grandeur and global power status. However, Moscow's more compact layout, architectural eclecticism incorporating Slavic elements, harsher winters, and lower population density give it a more distinctly Russian character compared to its Western European counterparts.}

::U2L6Q50::Answer the following questions.<br>Explain the unique features, geography and culture of some of Moscow’s major suburban districts.{=Areas like Zelenograd developed as dense Soviet-era industrial and residential districts.

Krasnogorsk has a renowned artisanal community producing traditional Russian woodcarvings, pottery and lace.}

::U2L6Q51::Answer the following questions.<br>Assess the strengths and weaknesses of Moscow’s urban planning, transportation infrastructure, preservation of historic sites and city services.{=Strengths include Moscow's radial urban design, investments in public transit infrastructure like the Metro, and preservation efforts around the Kremlin and historic Kitay-gorod district.

::U2L6Q52::Answer the following questions.<br>Predict Moscow’s future development and speculate whether it will retain its historic Russian character or become more globalized like other world cities.{=Moscow will likely retain its status as Russia's preeminent city while undergoing continued growth, globalization and Westernization.
