::U7L5Q42::Answer the following questions.<br>How did 9/11 and the "War on Terror" impact the decision to invade Iraq?{=9/11 dramatically shaped the War on Terror, making the U.S. more aggressive toward perceived extremist threats abroad.

::U7L5Q46::Answer the following questions.<br>Why did an insurgency emerge following the fall of Saddam Hussein? Who was involved and what tactics did they use?{=Various Iraqi groups resentful of foreign occupation and newly ascendant political rivals launched an insurgency campaign involving guerrilla assaults, suicide bombings, kidnappings and more.

It did not ascribe bad faith but faulted Blair's judgment.}

::U7L5Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>What factors made the 2003 Iraq War highly controversial internationally?{=Controversies included faulty WMD evidence, insufficient UN approval, lack of proof linking Iraq to terrorism, significantly higher than expected casualties, damage to US/UK credibility and the perception that oil interests and imperialism were central motivators.}

::U7L5Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>How did the failure to locate WMDs in Iraq affect the political debate about the invasion?{=The failure to locate WMD stockpiles undermined the credibility of invasion supporters by eliminating what was for many the most compelling stated reason for war.
