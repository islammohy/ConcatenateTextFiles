::U3L1Q40::Answer the following questions.<br>What is the greenhouse effect and why is it important?{=The greenhouse effect is the trapping of heat from the sun in the Earth's atmosphere by greenhouse gases. It is important because the natural greenhouse effect is essential for maintaining a habitable average temperature on Earth.}

::U3L1Q41::Answer the following questions.<br>How do human activities contribute to climate change?{=Human activities like burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agriculture and certain industrial processes emit greenhouse gases, amplifying the greenhouse effect and contributing to climate change.}

::U3L1Q42::Answer the following questions.<br>What are some impacts of global warming?{=Impacts of global warming include rising sea levels, more frequent and severe heatwaves, changing precipitation patterns that can increase floods or droughts, ocean acidification harming marine ecosystems and disruptions to biodiversity and natural habitats.}

::U3L1Q43::Answer the following questions.<br>What adaptation strategies could Moscow implement to deal with climate change?{=Moscow’s climate adaptation strategies could include improving heat-resilient urban planning using reflective materials and green spaces, enhancing water resource management systems, and developing emergency response plans for extreme weather events worsened by climate change.}

::U3L1Q44::Answer the following questions.<br>Describe the step-by-step development of a hurricane.{=Hurricanes develop from tropical disturbances which organize into tropical depressions. As wind speeds increase, they become tropical storms and then eventually hurricanes if winds exceed 74 mph. Hurricanes have a well-defined eye surrounded by an intense eyewall of thunderstorms.}

::U3L1Q45::Answer the following questions.<br>How do greenhouse gases emitted from human activities differ from natural greenhouse gas emissions?{=Natural greenhouse gas emissions maintain a livable climate on Earth. Human emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fuels, agriculture, deforestation and industry are excess emissions that amplify the greenhouse effect more than natural cycles can balance, causing global warming and climate change.}

::U3L1Q46::Answer the following questions.<br>What measures can individuals take to reduce their impact on climate change?{=Individuals can drive and fly less, walk, bike, or use public transport to reduce emissions. They can also switch household utilities to renewable options, improve home insulation, eat less meat, waste less food and participate in reforestation tree planting activities in their local area.}

::U3L1Q47::Answer the following questions.<br>What are the pros and cons of different alternative energy sources?{=Solar and wind energy produce no direct emissions but rely on batteries or other technology to provide consistent power. Hydroelectric power provides very consistent renewable electricity but affects local water supplies and ecosystems. Biofuels may have fewer emissions but still release carbon and require land and resources to produce. Nuclear produces no direct emissions but poses radioactive waste risks and disasters.}

::U3L1Q48::Answer the following questions.<br>Should governments prioritize climate change mitigation or local economic development? Why?{=Governments should balance mitigation and development based on level of development, resources, vulnerabilities, etc. Poorer countries may focus first on development to reduce poverty and build resilient infrastructure. Rich countries who historically benefitted most from emissions may have more responsibility to lead in mitigation efforts. Mitigating climate change supports long-term development.}

::U3L1Q49::Answer the following questions.<br>How would you convince a climate change skeptic to take action on this issue?{=would focus on localized effects they already see, connect impacts to values they hold dear, discuss risk management/prevention, provide apolitical scientific evidence, give concrete reasonable steps they can take, appeal to responsibility we each have towards future generations. The goal is finding common ground and planting seeds of willingness to address this complex challenge.}
